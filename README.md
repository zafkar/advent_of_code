# Advent of code

My advent of code of code writeup fully in rust

Some of the days will only have the second part of the challenge working.

## How to run

At the root of the repo launch :

```bash
cargo run --bin <binary_name>
```

with `<binary_name>` being `<year>_<day>` for example

```bash
cargo run --bin 2024_9
```
